Import the dataset, without the initial column of row names
All columns need to be numeric
Then add row names for plotting
```{r}
comm<-read.csv("2012_abundancematrix.csv")
rownames(comm) <- c("B1GA", "B1GB", "BIUA", "B1UB", "B2GA", "B2GB", "B2UA", "B2UB", "I1GA", "I1GB", "I1UA", "I1UB", "I2GA", "I2GB", "I2UA", "I2UB", "K1GA", "K1GB", "K1UA", "K1UB", "K2GA", "K2GB", "K2UA", "K2UB")
```

Need to create a matrix with trait abundance values (site by trait, derived from site by species).  Potentially follow method in Ackerly and Cornwell 2007?

fill a new matrix - for each community, make columns for each trait, average trait values for each species in the community

would a species by trait matrix help?
