Import the dataset, without the initial column of row names
All columns need to be numeric
Then add row names for plotting
Reframe the matrices so that the site names are row names and not a column

```{r}
require(RCurl)
options(RCurlOptions = list(cainfo = system.file("CurlSSL", "cacert.pem", package = "RCurl")))
raw <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erollinson/Dissertation/master/2012_abundancematrix_modified.csv") #insert the  raw URL for the data file on github here
comm<- read.csv(text = raw) #read in the github file

```




Need to create a matrix with trait abundance values (site by trait, derived from site by species).  Potentially follow method in Ackerly and Cornwell 2007?

fill a new matrix - for each community, make columns for each trait, average trait values for each species in the community

would a species by trait matrix help?
