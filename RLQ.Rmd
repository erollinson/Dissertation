A vague attempt at RLQ analysis
========================================================

Read in the data
```{r}
traits<-read.csv("site_by_trait_matrix_interp.csv") #this would be better if I make a new traits matrix with all 2013 species, then a presence/absence matrix for all 2013 species


```

```{r}
require(ade4)
```


coa1<- dudi.coa(on a site x species abundance matrix with species in rows)
dudimil<- dudi.hillsmith(on a site x environment matrix with environment in rows)
duditrait<- dudi.hillsmith(on a species x trait matrix with traits in rows)
rlq1 <-rlq (dudimil, coa1, duditrait)
