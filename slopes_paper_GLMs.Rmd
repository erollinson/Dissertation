Some notes on useful code tidbits
-------------------------------------------------------

Note that in RStudio, the data fram view only displays a certain number of columns.  For a large dataset, if you need to view the entire data frame, you can use the command below to open it in a separate window.

utils::View(data)

```{r}
utils::View(matrix)
```

Fixing the data frames a bit
-------------------------------------------------------
Adding total herbaceous cover

```{r}
summed<-rowSums(data[,c(28,29)])
data <-cbind(data, summed)
names(data)[names(data)=="summed"] <- "HerbCov"
data$HerbCov[data$HerbCov > 1] <- 1
```

GLMs
-------------------------------------------------------

Poisson regression is required for the following variables:
species richness (overall; introduced; native)
number of individuals (overall; introduced; native)

Check if these are very over/underdispersed or have a lot of zeroes; if so, a different model is required.
Potential problem: All of these data are corrected per area sampled, which does not work with the straightforward Poisson model (which requires integers).  An alternate method for performing Poisson regression on non-integers is provided at http://www.r-bloggers.com/poisson-regression-on-non-integers/, although I don't completely follow it.

It throws a warning for the model that the values are non-integer but fits the model and allows an anova to be run, and stackexchange suggests that it is apporpriate to use the Poisson distribution even for non-integers that are still best approximated by Poisson (http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/70054/how-is-it-possible-that-poisson-glm-accepts-non-integer-numbers).  Using family quasipoisson instead of poisson suppresses these warnings.



```{r}

rich<-glm(CountSpPerM ~ River + (River/Site) + (Site/Bank), family="quasipoisson", data=data)
summary(rich) #I have no idea how to interpret this output


rich<-glm(CountSpPerM ~ River + Site + Bank, family="quasipoisson", data=data)
summary(rich)
```


Logistic regression for: %cover (%int; %nat)

```{r}
cover<-glm(HerbCov ~ River + (River/Site) + (Site/Bank), family="quasibinomial", data=data) #quasibinomial runs binomial and suppresses the stupid error messages
summary(cover)

```




Multinomial diversity model MDM for Shannon diversity (see De'ath 2012 Ecology 93:2286-2296)
This needs to start with a site by species abundance matrix, create a class MDM out of it

```{r}
fit0<-mdm(y2p(matrix[,4:246])~1, data=matrix)
fit1<-mdm(y2p(matrix[,4:246])~1 + Stream, data=matrix)
fit2<-mdm(y2p(matrix[,4:246])~1 + Site, data=matrix)
fit3<-mdm(y2p(matrix[,4:246])~1 + Elev, data=matrix)
anova(fit0, fit1, fit2, fit3)
#No idea how to interpret this
```




Species accumulation curves
----------------------------------------------
Resort the matrix so it is sorted by the Elev column

```{r}
require(data.table)
matsort<-data.table(matrix, key="Elev")
```

Run species accumulation function for greenlines and upslopes separately
```{r}
#greenlines
gl<-specaccum(matrix[1:12, 4:246], method="exact", permutations = 999, conditioned = TRUE)
#upslope
up<-specaccum(matrix[13:24, 4:246], method="exact", permutations = 999, conditioned = TRUE)
plot(gl, ci.type="line", ci.col="blue")
plot(up, add=TRUE, ci.type="line", ci.col="red")
```


This code works, but I should implement it at a finer scale than over 12 sites.  Quadrat level would work; need a solution for how to integrate woody species?  Maybe just as a "woody" quadrat.  Can test this code at for herbaceous plants only using the dataset used in the Permutation seminar. Note this is *herbaceous plants only*, and is missing morphospecies that could not be identified to species or species that do not have a definite native/introduced origin status. 

```{r}
herbs<-read.csv("herbs_quadratlevel.csv")

#greenlines
gl<-specaccum(herbs[1:240, 3:165], method="random", permutations = 999, conditioned = TRUE)
#upslope
up<-specaccum(herbs[241:480, 3:165], method="random", permutations = 999, conditioned = TRUE)
plot(gl, ci.type="line", ci.col="blue")
plot(up, add=TRUE, ci.type="line", ci.col="red")
```
